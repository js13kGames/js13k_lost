Humankind is at a technological crossroads and soon we may be faced with some difficult choices regarding dignity and freedom. As more and more of our traditional jobs are replaced by software and robotics, we will be forced to relinquish our responsibilities to computerized systems which will, undeniably, be safer and more predictable, and therefore superior. But when these benefits come at the cost of our dignity and purpose in life, we must question how much of our freedoms should be given up, and resist automation when necessary.

This game has no end, and a tireless computer opponent. It is meant to illustrate how relentless and apathetic software systems can be, and hopefully to remind the player to question automation in the workplace, before the essence of humankind is lost.

The way to score points is to get the ball to hit the edge of your paddle, sending it off at a sharp angle.

Alternatively, you can use touch or mouse button to grab the ball and release as you're moving the paddle, throwing it at a sharp angle.

Good luck!
